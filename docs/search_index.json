[["index.html", "R4Stats About Usage Render book Preview book", " R4Stats Colin Madland 2023-03-04 About This is a sample book written in Markdown. You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports; for example, a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). Usage Each bookdown chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter must start with a first-level heading: # A good chapter, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: ## A short section or ### An even shorter section. The index.Rmd file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. Render book You can render the HTML version of this example book without changing anything: Find the Build pane in the RStudio IDE, and Click on Build Book, then select your output format, or select “All formats” if you’d like to use multiple formats from the same book source files. Or build the book from the R console: bookdown::render_book() To render this example to PDF as a bookdown::pdf_book, you’ll need to install XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.org/tinytex/. Preview book As you work, you may start a local server to live preview this HTML book. This preview will update as you edit the book when you save individual .Rmd files. You can start the server in a work session by using the RStudio add-in “Preview book”, or from the R console: bookdown::serve_book() "],["getting-started-with-r.html", "Chapter 1 Getting Started with R 1.1 Problems", " Chapter 1 Getting Started with R 1.1 Problems 1+2*(3+4) ## [1] 15 (4^3)+(3^(2+1)) ## [1] 91 sqrt(4+3)*(2+1) ## [1] 7.937254 (1+(2*3^4))/(5/6)-7 ## [1] 188.6 (0.25 - 0.2) / (0.2 * (1 - 0.2)/100)^(1/2) ## [1] 1.25 x &lt;- 2 y &lt;- 3 z &lt;- 4 w &lt;- 5 x*y*z*w ## [1] 120 rivers ## [1] 735 320 325 392 524 450 1459 135 465 600 330 336 280 315 870 ## [16] 906 202 329 290 1000 600 505 1450 840 1243 890 350 407 286 280 ## [31] 525 720 390 250 327 230 265 850 210 630 260 230 360 730 600 ## [46] 306 390 420 291 710 340 217 281 352 259 250 470 680 570 350 ## [61] 300 560 900 625 332 2348 1171 3710 2315 2533 780 280 410 460 260 ## [76] 255 431 350 760 618 338 981 1306 500 696 605 250 411 1054 735 ## [91] 233 435 490 310 460 383 375 1270 545 445 1885 380 300 380 377 ## [106] 425 276 210 800 420 350 360 538 1100 1205 314 237 610 360 540 ## [121] 1038 424 310 300 444 301 268 620 215 652 900 525 246 360 529 ## [136] 500 720 270 430 671 1770 Orange ## Tree age circumference ## 1 1 118 30 ## 2 1 484 58 ## 3 1 664 87 ## 4 1 1004 115 ## 5 1 1231 120 ## 6 1 1372 142 ## 7 1 1582 145 ## 8 2 118 33 ## 9 2 484 69 ## 10 2 664 111 ## 11 2 1004 156 ## 12 2 1231 172 ## 13 2 1372 203 ## 14 2 1582 203 ## 15 3 118 30 ## 16 3 484 51 ## 17 3 664 75 ## 18 3 1004 108 ## 19 3 1231 115 ## 20 3 1372 139 ## 21 3 1582 140 ## 22 4 118 32 ## 23 4 484 62 ## 24 4 664 112 ## 25 4 1004 167 ## 26 4 1231 179 ## 27 4 1372 209 ## 28 4 1582 214 ## 29 5 118 30 ## 30 5 484 49 ## 31 5 664 81 ## 32 5 1004 125 ## 33 5 1231 142 ## 34 5 1372 174 ## 35 5 1582 177 mean(Orange$age) ## [1] 922.1429 max(Orange$circumference) ## [1] 214 "],["univariate.html", "Chapter 2 Univariate data Levels of measurement 2.1 Data Vectors 2.2 Numeric summaries 2.3 categorical data", " Chapter 2 Univariate data Levels of measurement The view in most textbooks is from Stanley Smith Stevens (1964) Definition 2.1 Nominal Such data is qualitative or descriptive, but not numeric. An example might be the name of a person or the town they are from, or the number on a bib a runner wears in a race. Definition 2.2 Ordinal Ordinal data is data with some order, so that we can sort the data from largest to smallest. An example might be the place a runner takes in a race. Definition 2.3 Interval Interval data is ordinal data where the difference between two values has some interpretation. The clock time a person finishes might be an example. If we know runner a finishes at noon and runner B at 1PM then we know that runner B took longer. Since we haven’t specified when they started, we don’t know what percent longer though. Definition 2.4 Ratio Ration data has a meaningful 0. If we record not the time of finishing, but the time since starting, then 0 has a meaning and we can take a ration of the total time for runner A and B to compare the two. However, working with data on a computer is different, requiring different categories… Definition 2.5 Factor When we look at many variables, some may simply record categories used to group the data. In R we will use factors to store these variables. An example might be the browser a user has used to view a website, as gleaned from a log. Definition 2.6 character Some categorical data are factors, but others are really just identifiers, and are not used for grouping. An example might be a user’s IP address. Difference can be thought of as distinguishing between categorizing a case or characterizing a case. While both factor and categorical data are nominal, we keep the distinction as we will interact with the data differently. Definition 2.7 discrete Discrete data comes from measurements where there are essentially only distinct and separate possible values that can be counted. For example, the number of visits a person makes to a website will always be integer data, as will other counting data. Definition 2.8 continuous Data which could conceivably come from a continuum of variables. The recording of time in milliseconds of a visit to a website might be such data. A useful distinction is that for discrete data we expect that cases will share values, whereas for continuous data this will be impossible, or at least very unlikely. We can also turn continuous data into discrete data by truncating (record the minute instead of the millisecond) or by binning.Rather than draw distinctions between ordinal, interval, and ratio, it is more important for statistical theory - in finding a model for the recorded data - to know if the data is discrete or continuous. Definition 2.9 time and date Though we just saw that time and date can be considered continuous or discrete, for computers there are often separate ways to handle date and time data. Issues that complicate matters are leap days and time zones, but also scale (some people want millisecond data) Definition 2.10 hierarchical while much data is several measurements for several cases and fits nicely onto a rectangular spreadsheet, data on networks does not fit this 2.1 Data Vectors Suppose the number of whale beachings in Texas during the 1990s was 74 122 235 111 292 111 211 133 156 79 We can combine these into a data set through whale &lt;- c(74, 122, 235, 111, 292, 111, 211, 133, 156, 79) The whale object is a data vector. the size of the data set is retreived with the length function length(whale) ##

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
